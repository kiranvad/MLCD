# Metric Learning for Combinatorial Datasets (MLCD)
This repository contains the MATLAB code to perform metric learning for a combinatorial datasets. The correspondng paper is listed below:
>> K.Vaddi, O.Wodo, Metric Learning for High-throughput Combinatorial Data Sets Under review ACS Combinatorial Sciences~(submitted April 2019).

Our software would require MATLAB 2018b or higher with mex files compatability.
Along with the MLCD code, we have also distributed the MT-LMNN code which accompanies the following paper.

>>Parameswaran, Shibin, and Kilian Q. Weinberger. "Large margin multi-task metric learning."
Advances in neural information processing systems. 2010

We thank the autors of MT-LMNN for letting us use the software under MIT-Licence which is attached to the corresponding folder.

## Demo(s)
This repository contains the following demos:
* To perform a demo of MT-LMNN from the original paer by Shibin et.al, run `demo_MTLMNN.m`
* To perform a demo of MLCD on an open source XRD dataset, run `demo_MLCD.m`

## Notes
We have also provided the codes for the data and analysis used in our paper Vaddi et.al, in the folder `MLCD_paper`. You can find more details on reproducing the results from the paper in `MLCD_paper` folder.
