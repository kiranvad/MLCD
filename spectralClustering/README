This directory contains the code for Normalized Cut
and the nystromized version of it.

The main linear algebra code is in ncut.m and nystrom_ncut.m
To use these engines, we use the drivers in ncut_driver and nystrom_driver.

An example of their use is given in threegaussexample.m

It constructs a mixture of three gaussians and seperated them out using the ncut algorithm.

Another example is colorimageexample.m
which segments an image based on the cues of color and proximity.
